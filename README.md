AudioTagger
===========
AudioTagger is a command-line tool for reading and writing audio tags. Under the covers, it leans on the excellent jaudiotagger library for reading and writing to audio files. Therefore, this is mostly just a wrapper that allows for an easy execution of jaudiotagger's functionality.

Windows

Right now, I only have scripts for Windows. Later, I'll add bash scripts.
